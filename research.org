** Introduction:
   A joint research adventure by jaw & smart
   
*** Goal (ideas):
    - to Explore our passions/interests/...
    - to apply ourselves (to the best of our abilities)
    - to learn/grow/discover/...
    - ...

*** Other:
    - could add todo's here, make this like our research journal...

**** TODO
     - finalise the steps
     - finalise our individual and shared interests 
     - find interesting/fun/unique/creative/... ideas for each of the steps. 
     - begin examining different topics and more specific directions

**** The "equation":
     
     The equation that we divised about what/how we want to do (things), which we can then apply to various different application
 
     **It goes as follows**:

     Overview of main steps: 
         Step 1: Analyse the (appplied) science of some system
             - more theoretical
             - potential systems:
               - **Extremes**
               - Quantum stuff (cross-computing)? 
               
         Step 2: Model it 
         
         Step 3: Apply the model in some (computationally) creative manner to some system
             - more analytical
             - potential systems: 
               - climate stuff
               - public health
               
         Step 4: End result! 
             - analysis
             - conclusions

brainstorming the steps and adding more detail explaining what each will entail 

***** step 1: applied science of a system
- choose a system 
	- why this system? how is it relevant? so what? 
- theoretical review and analysis 
	- collect information about the relevant aspects of the system
	- collate and link 
- questions: 
	- what physics is relevant to understanding the system? 
	- what mathematics? 
	- which of these aspects are essential to include in a model, which are not? 
	- which modelling methods are appropriate and why? 
- based on the above,
-  select a specific aspect of the system to model, complete with relevant fundamentals
- formulate research question(s) and objective(s) 
- think about what we want to make conclusions on 

***** step 2: the model / simulation
From step 1, will already have some understanding of the problem definition and constraints, so will then need to find modelling methods that account for these and select one – need to perform a short search and analysis before creating the actual model. 
- Inspiration
      - cellular automata (build something similar)
      - network theory
- make clear problem definition
- what resources do we need? 
	- collect information on the type of model 
	- examples of similar use 
	- justifications for each choice 
- cross-computing 
- think about opportunities to compare more than one modelling method
- decide which quantitative and qualitative aspects to explore/measure 
	- why these?
	- what do they show? 

This step entails model exploration and justification, the next model application. (??)

***** step 3: apply the model
Based on choices made in step 2, create a model and include all relevant system aspects from step 1. This is the product, so will require the most thought and work. 
- hypotheses: 
	- how do we expect the metrics chosen in step 2 to relate to the aims/objectives from step 1? 
- collect results on the selected metrics 
- follow best-computing practices for model: large files, imports etc. 

***** step 4: analyse results, conclude 
This largely depends on what is found in step 3; which results are collected and what they show. 
- think about different methods of analysis and which are appropriate for the chosen metrics 
- verify our results 
- compare to the literature where possible 
- why does this matter? 
- what do our conclusions show? 
	- be rigorous !
